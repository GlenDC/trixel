Trixel, make trixel art.

Latest version can be used for free @ [https://glendc.github.io/trixel/](https://glendc.github.io/trixel/).

## Editor Controls

As the GUI is still crappy at this point, here are the controls currently functional:

+ **Left Mouse Click**: Paint
+ **Left Mouse Click + Alt**: Pick Color
+ **Left Mouse Click + Ctrl**: Erase
+ **G**: Toggle Grid
+ **Keyboard Arrows**: Move workspace (only works when zoomed in)
