# About

## Opensource and Free

I'm a big believer of [free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). In the case of Trixel, the free is also gratis. The source code and issues of Trixel can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/GlenDC/trixel).

Additionally you can also just comment on an issue that you want to resolve, or open an issue related to a bug or feature you want. Once you're finished you can open a pull request, so that the review-and-merge process can begin.
